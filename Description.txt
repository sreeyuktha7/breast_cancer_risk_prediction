Cancer Type: General classification of the cancer type (e.g., invasive ductal carcinoma).

Cancer Type Detailed: More specific classification of the cancer type.

Cellularity: The degree of cellularity of the tumor, often used in pathology to describe the proportion of cells versus other components in a tissue sample.

Chemotherapy: Indicates whether the patient received chemotherapy (Yes/No).

Pam50 + Claudin-low subtype: Subtypes based on gene expression profiling, including Pam50 and Claudin-low classifications.

Cohort: The group or study cohort to which the patient belongs.

ER status measured by IHC: Estrogen receptor status as measured by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g., positive or negative).

ER Status: Estrogen receptor status (e.g., positive, negative).

Neoplasm Histologic Grade: Histologic grade of the neoplasm, indicating how much the tumor cells differ from normal cells.

HER2 status measured by SNP6: HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) status measured by SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis.

HER2 Status: HER2 receptor status (e.g., positive, negative).

Tumor Other Histologic Subtype: Other histologic subtypes of the tumor not covered by main classifications.

Hormone Therapy: Indicates whether the patient received hormone therapy (Yes/No).

Inferred Menopausal State: Menopausal state inferred based on age and clinical criteria (e.g., premenopausal, postmenopausal).

Integrative Cluster: Classification based on integrative clustering of genomic data.

Primary Tumor Laterality: The side of the body where the primary tumor is located (left or right).

Lymph nodes examined positive: Number of lymph nodes that tested positive for cancer.

Mutation Count: Total number of genetic mutations identified in the tumor.

Nottingham prognostic index: Prognostic score based on tumor size, lymph node status, and histologic grade.

Oncotree Code: A code that represents the type of cancer based on the OncoTree classification.

Overall Survival (Months): The overall survival time of the patient in months.

Overall Survival Status: Indicates whether the patient is alive or deceased.

PR Status: Progesterone receptor status (e.g., positive, negative).

Radio Therapy: Indicates whether the patient received radiotherapy (Yes/No).

Relapse Free Status (Months): Time in months the patient remained free from cancer relapse.

Relapse Free Status: Indicates whether the patient has had a relapse of cancer (Yes/No).

Sex: The sex of the patient (male or female).

3-Gene classifier subtype: Subtypes based on the expression of three specific genes.

Tumor Size: Size of the primary tumor.

Tumor Stage: Stage of the tumor, indicating the extent of cancer spread.

Patient's Vital Status: Indicates whether the patient is alive or deceased at the last follow-up.
