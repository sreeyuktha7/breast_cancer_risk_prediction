# Breast Cancer Risk Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop comprehensive survival analysis models and a machine learning model to predict the 10-year mortality risk for breast cancer patients. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning, the project seeks to improve treatment planning, patient counseling, and overall cancer care strategies.

## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of survival trends and identification of influential factors.
- Survival Analysis Models: Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox Proportional Hazards models.
- Machine Learning: Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms for accurate 10-year mortality prediction.
- Feature Engineering: Focus on factors like tumor stage, surgery type, and survival status to optimize prediction accuracy.

## Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
-Libraries:
  - pandas and numpy for data manipulation
  - matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
  - scikit-learn for machine learning models
  - lifelines for survival analysis
  - statsmodels for statistical modeling
 
## Project Benefits

- Treatment Optimization: Identifies factors influencing survival to tailor treatment plans.
